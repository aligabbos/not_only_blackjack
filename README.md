# Not only blackjack

This game is a simple version of European blackjack 1 vs dealer.<br>
I have created this game basically for approching myself with the python programming language and obviusly for fun.

## Getting started

* [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/), install and configure the newest version of python if you have not install it yet
* Download the zip file or clone this project
* Navigate to the project folder
* Run in a python shell the **not_only_blackjack.py** file
* Enjoy the game!

```
$ cd to/the/project/folder
$ python not_only_blackjack.py
```

### Prerequisites

I have used the [formatted string literals](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#tut-f-strings) like this

```
name = 'John Doe'
print(f'Hello {name}')
```
That is not supported for older versions of python.<br>
I am using the 3.7.x version of python
